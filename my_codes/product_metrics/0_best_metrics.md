 - General Advertising Companies
    - Business Model
        - Advertisers pay website owners to 1)display advertising on their site, 2)pay website owners to refer visitors to the advertiserâ€™s website, or 3)display advertising messages with the ability for the consumer to click through to their website.
    - Journey
        - companies gives adversertizing companies the information of ads they want to show. 
        - then, ads company will tell them where they can put their ads
        - companies will decide which options to take, and the ads company will request for cost per day.
        - profit = (cost per ads) * (click volume)
    - Metrics
        - ads engagement: views (of ads), engagement (of ads)
        - site performance: website visitor (session volume), views, active user
        - click through rate

2. What would be good metrics of success for a service-driven consumer product? (Uber, Flickr, Venmo, etc.)
- General Service-Driven Model
    - Business Model (Uber)
        - Service-driven model. They provide service to the customers but they do not make the service for themselves. For example, Uber provide a ride to a custemer but Uber entrust the service to a driver. 
    - Journey
        - company has two kinds of custemers. drivers and users.
        - company provides the service (a ride) to users. each time they use the service (take a ride within the app), users will pay. 
        - drivers will get a certain amount of money for each ride, and the company will get part of the money for service fee. 
        - users can give tips to the drivers if they enjoyed their experience with the driver.
    - Metrics
        - at user's side, first they open the app and search for a driver. here, the user want to find a driver immediately so waiting time is one important metrics for user's experience. Next, after they have matched, the user want to have a safe and good ride. This metrics can be measured by user's rating for the ride. After their experience, if the user feel satisfied with the service, the user will use the service again and maybe become an active user. In summary, at user's side, good metrics of success would be 1) waiting time, 2) ratings, 3) active users, 4) conversions (total ride volume). Then how about drivers side? Uber's success would also rely on drivers. For example, to minimize the waiting time there should be enough number of drivers and they have to cover all the area of Uber's users. At driver's side, they want to earn more money with short amount of time. Therefore, waiting time is also important metrics for drivers to keep the drivers in the service. Also, their hourly weige can also be good metrics of success. In summery, 1) user and driver's waiting time, 2) user's ratings, 3) active users 4) conversions (total ride volume), 5) hourly weige of a driver, would be good metrics for success.
